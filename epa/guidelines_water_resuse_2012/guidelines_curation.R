  "Aluminum", 5.0, "Can cause nonproductiveness in acid soils, but soils at pH 5.5 to 8.0 will precipitate the ion and eliminate toxicity",
  "Arsenic", 0.10, "Toxicity to plants varies widely, ranging from 12 mg/L for Sudan grass to less than 0.05 mg/L for rice",
  "Beryllium", 0.10, "Toxicity to plants varies widely, ranging from 5 mg/L for kale to 0.5 mg/L for bush beans",
  "Boron", 0.75, "Essential to plant growth; sufficient quantities in reclaimed water to correct soil deficiencies. Optimum yields obtained at few-tenths mg/L; toxic to sensitive plants (e.g., citrus) at 1 mg/L. Most grasses are tolerant at 2.0 - 10 mg/L",
  "Cadmium", 0.01, "Toxic to beans, beets, and turnips at concentrations as low as 0.1 mg/L; conservative limits are recommended",
  "Chromium", 0.1, "Not generally recognized as an essential element; due to lack of toxicity data, conservative limits are recommended",
  "Cobalt", 0.05, "Toxic to tomatoes at 0.1 mg/L; tends to be inactivated by neutral and alkaline soils",

  "Lead", 5.0, "Can inhibit plant cell growth at very high concentrations",
  "Lithium", 2.5, "Tolerated by most crops up to 5 mg/L; mobile in soil. Toxic to citrus at low dosesâ€”recommended limit is 0.075 mg/L",
  "Manganese", 0.2, "Toxic to a number of crops at few-tenths to few mg/L in acidic soils",
  "Molybdenum", 0.01, "Nontoxic to plants; can be toxic to livestock if forage is grown in soils with high molybdenum",
  "Nickel", 0.2, "Toxic to a number of plants at 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L; reduced toxicity at neutral or alkaline pH",
  "Selenium", 0.02, "Toxic to plants at low concentrations and to livestock if forage is grown in soils with low levels of selenium",
  "Tin, Tungsten, and Titanium", NA, "Excluded by plants; specific tolerance levels unknown",
  "Vanadium", 0.1, "Toxic to many plants at relatively low concentrations",
  "Zinc", 2.0, "Toxic to many plants at widely varying concentrations; reduced toxicity at increased pH (6 or above) and in fine-textured or organic soils"
