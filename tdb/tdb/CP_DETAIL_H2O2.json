Fenton reaction, an advanced oxidation technology makes use of Fe2+ and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Photo-assisted Fenton reaction uses light in the solar spectral region to increase the rate of reaction. This study used natural sunlight.  Test water was obtained from lysimeters from an experimental greenhouse located in Campo de Cartagena, Spain. The water was spiked with Folicur ME 10% WG containing tebuconazole as active ingredient.
