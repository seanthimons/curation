The most common resin used was strong-base anionic resins, which showed high affinity for perchlorate. Polystyrene, polyvinylpyridine, and polyacrylic are promising ion exchange resins for perchlorate. Regardless of regenerating or directly disposing of the spent resins, IX is an incomplete technology. The necessity for regeneration or periodic replacement of ion-exchange resins makes the operation and maintenance of IX treatment systems expensive compared to anaerobic biofiltration (which has other concerns). High concentration of sodium chloride or a caustic solution or low concentration of ammonium hydroxide can be used for regeneration depending upon the resin. Perchlorate has as high affinity for virtually all anion resins, all IX columns removing perchlorate should be operated in a countercurrent fashion i.e., exhaustion in one direction and regeneration in another direction. &nbsp; Distribution system impacts from ion exchange treatment processes will largely depend on the type and specificity of the resins and the mode of use. The more specific the resin is to perchlorate, the less inadvertent co-removal of beneficial anionic species will occur over the bed-life of the resin.
