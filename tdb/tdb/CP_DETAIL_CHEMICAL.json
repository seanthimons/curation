The percent removal was independent of the initial perchlorate concentration.\r\nThe experiment results suggests that perchlorate can be removed up to almost 100% during the initial phases of the contact in the pH ranges of 2.0-2.5, which is believed to be due to formation of a complex between perchlorate and phosphoric acid that subsequently absorbs to particle surfaces. At higher pH values very little perchlorate removal was observed. However, even at acidic pH, continuous contact with the surface coupled with agitation and pH rise seems to release the perchlorate back to the solution.\r\nThe requirement of very acidic conditions and subsequent neutralization for pH restoration might make this process expensive.","tmsp_last_updt":"09-FEB-21"}

However, after 5 minutes of contact time, the perchlorate concentration started to increase from 300ug\/L to around 900ug\/L, indicating that removal was due to a reversible adsorption on the metallic surface. The influent pH increased from 2 to 3.5 at the end of 120 min contact time which showing that pH increase occured as percholorate desorption started.The study was performed with presence of 100 g\/L of Fe(0).\r\n\r\nThe experiment results suggests that perchlorate can be removed up to almost 100% during the initial phases of the contact in the pH ranges of 2.0-2.5, which is believed to be due to formation of a complex between perchlorate and phosphoric acid that subsequently absorbs to particle surfaces. At higher pH values very little perchlorate removal was observed. However, even at acidic pH, continuous contact with the surface coupled with agitation and pH rise seems to release the perchlorate back to the solution.\r\nThe requirement of very acidic conditions and subsequent neutralization for pH restoration might make this process expensive.","tmsp_last_updt":"09-FEB-21"}

The influent pH increased from 2 to 3.5 at the end of 120 min contact time which showing that pH increase occured as percholorate desorption started.The study was performed with presence of 100 g\/L of Fe(0).\r\n\r\nThe experiment results suggests that perchlorate can be removed up to almost 100% during the initial phases of the contact in the pH ranges of 2.0-2.5, which is believed to be due to formation of a complex between perchlorate and phosphoric acid that subsequently absorbs to particle surfaces. At higher pH values very little perchlorate removal was observed. However, even at acidic pH, continuous contact with the surface coupled with agitation and pH rise seems to release the perchlorate back to the solution.\r\nThe requirement of very acidic conditions and subsequent neutralization for pH restoration might make this process expensive.","tmsp_last_updt":"18-JUN-09"}
